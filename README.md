- 👋 Hi, I’m @ArchitB17976
- 👀 I’m interested in anything related to hardware (Embedded systems, OS work, FPGAs, etc.), as well as something I'd like to call "memory discipline" where the programmer is mindful of how much memory is being used in excuting their program. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C/C++, Mbed Studio and python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, unfortunately. I'd like to work on honing my skills before I go into the deep end and collaborate
- 📫 How to reach me - Shoot me a mail: fnthabyf@anonaddy.me - I'm up for a chat regarding anything under the sun. Will highly appreciate if you're learning in a similar field or something, but just banting works too.
